# Inventory Management System

A full-stack inventory management system built as a Turborepo monorepo with a Hono/Bun API backend and Expo React Native mobile app.

---

## Project Overview

Track products, manage stock levels, and record stock transactions (IN/OUT) with role-based access (admin/staff). The mobile app communicates with a REST API, authenticated via JWT.

---

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Version |
|---|---|
| Node.js | ≥ 18 |
| Bun | ≥ 1.0 |
| pnpm | ≥ 9.0 |
| PostgreSQL | ≥ 14 |
| Expo CLI | latest (`npx expo --version`) |
| Cloudinary account | Free tier works |

---

## Setup

### 1. Clone and install dependencies

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd inventory-app
pnpm install
```

### 2. Configure environment variables

```bash
# API
cp apps/api/.env.example apps/api/.env
# Edit apps/api/.env with:
# - DATABASE_URL
# - JWT_SECRET
# - CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME
# - CLOUDINARY_API_KEY
# - CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET

# Mobile
cp apps/mobile/.env.example apps/mobile/.env
# Edit EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL if your API runs on a different host/port
```

### 3. Run database migrations

```bash
cd apps/api
bun run db:generate   # generate SQL migration files from schema
bun run db:migrate    # apply migrations to the database
cd ../..
```

### 4. Start development servers

```bash
# From repo root — starts API + all apps simultaneously
pnpm dev

# Or run individually:
cd apps/api && bun run dev
cd apps/mobile && pnpm dev
# Optional: pnpm dev:lan | pnpm dev:localhost | pnpm dev:tunnel
```

The API runs at `http://localhost:3000`. Open the Expo app with Expo Go or a dev build.

## Completed Updates (March 12, 2026)

- **Expo Router v6 mobile shell**: authenticated tabs now include `Dashboard`, `Products`, and `Activity`.
- **System dark mode + manual theme toggle**: app follows device appearance and supports light/dark/system switching.
- **Barcode support end-to-end**:
  - `products.barcode` added in DB with unique constraint
  - new lookup endpoint `GET /products/barcode/:barcode`
  - scanner UI added for products list and product add/edit forms
  - supports EAN-13, EAN-8, UPC-A, UPC-E, and Code-128
  - scan-to-find opens product detail if found, otherwise offers prefilled Add Product
- **Image upload pipeline upgraded**: mobile uploads product images to Cloudinary using signed params; API stores HTTPS `imageUrl` only.
- **Base64 image migration support**: script added to migrate legacy `data:image/...` rows to hosted URLs.
- **Dashboard metrics expanded**:
  - `totalStockValue` (real `price * quantityInStock` aggregate)
  - stock flow as **net** movement (`IN - OUT`) for last 7 UTC days
  - safe zero-data handling (no BarChart crash path)
- **Products insights improved**: per-product dynamic trend badge (percent/units) and category filter UI.
- **Auth hardening**: mobile now clears token/user on API 401 and redirects to login via auth guard.
- **Inventory UX refinements**:
  - stock adjust modal is keyboard-aware on iOS/Android
  - after editing a product, user is redirected to Products tab
- **Detail freshness improvement**:
  - product detail refetches on screen focus to avoid stale data when navigating back through stack history
- **API test coverage additions**:
  - barcode lookup and barcode uniqueness controller behavior tests added (`bun:test`)
- **Repo hygiene updates**: `.expo/cache/**` ignored and tracked cache artifacts removed.

### Transactions

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Description |

### Dashboard

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/dashboard` | Yes | Returns `{ totalProducts, totalStockQuantity, totalStockValue, lowStockItems, recentTransactions, stockFlow, stockFlowHasTransactions, stockFlowNetTotal }` |

### Upload

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/upload/sign` | Yes | Returns signed Cloudinary upload params for mobile image upload |

### Health

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/health` | No | Health check |

## Key Design Decisions

- **JWT** signed with HS256 via `jose`, expires in 7 days. Payload: `{ sub, email, role }`
- **Stock transactions** run in a DB transaction — an OUT that would bring stock below 0 is rejected with HTTP 400
- **Low stock** threshold is `quantityInStock < 10`
- **Mobile** uses `expo-secure-store` for JWT persistence and auto-logs out on API 401
- **Barcode** is optional (`null`/missing allowed) but unique when present
- **Product images** are URL-only (`https://...`) and uploaded via Cloudinary signed flow (no base64 payload storage)
- **Dashboard stock flow** uses UTC day buckets and net units (`IN - OUT`)
- **Shared types** in `packages/types` are consumed as raw TypeScript source via path aliases — no build step needed

## Barcode Scanner Usage

### Prerequisites

1. API is running and connected to PostgreSQL.
2. Barcode migration is applied:

```bash
pnpm --filter @inventory/api db:migrate
```

3. Mobile app has camera permission granted.

Permission behavior:

- If camera permission is denied but can still be requested, tapping **Grant Permission** re-prompts.
- If camera permission is blocked by OS (`Don't ask again` / denied permanently), scanner shows **Open Settings** to enable camera manually.

### Scan to Find (Products Tab)

1. Open **Products** tab.
2. Tap the barcode icon in the header.
3. Scan a supported barcode.
4. If found, app opens product detail.
5. If not found, app shows prompt to open **Add Product** with prefilled barcode.

### Add/Edit Product with Scan

1. Open **Add Product** or **Edit Product**.
2. Tap barcode icon in the **Barcode (Optional)** field.
3. Scan a code.
4. Barcode field is filled from scanner output.
5. SKU is auto-filled only if SKU is currently empty.

### Currently Supported Barcode Types (v1)

- EAN-13
- EAN-8
- UPC-A
- UPC-E
- Code-128

## Troubleshooting

### Database connection intermittently fails (`ETIMEDOUT` / `ECONNREFUSED` on `:5432`)

Symptoms:

- API logs show connection timeout/refused errors for PostgreSQL host IPs.
- Some requests return `500`, later requests may return `200`.

Checks:

1. Confirm `apps/api/.env` has the correct `DATABASE_URL`.
2. Ensure your DB firewall/security group allows your current client IP on port `5432`.
3. If your provider uses IP allowlists, add your current IP.
4. If DB is private-only, connect via VPN/bastion/tunnel.
5. Restart API after fixing network access.

### `column "barcode" does not exist`

Cause:

- API code expects latest schema but DB migration has not been applied.

Fix:

```bash
pnpm --filter @inventory/api db:migrate
```

### Camera permission button appears not to work

Expected behavior:

- If permission can be requested again, scanner shows **Grant Permission**.
- If permission is permanently blocked, scanner shows **Open Settings** and permission must be enabled manually in device settings.
